Merging is when we want to consolidate two branches in one repository. 
For example, when we are done with some development on a branch and want to submit the additional code to the master branch.
When we merge 2 branches, it is possible there is some conflicts. This happens when several people have modified one part of codes.
If there are any conflicts, we need to resolve it first before merging the branches.
