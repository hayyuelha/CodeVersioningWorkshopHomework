Branching is a collaborative feature in git that enable us to work on some part of the projects without disturbing the development of other parts of the project.
The best practice is to create a new branch when we want to start developing a new feature. 
A branch will contain the snapshot of the project. After creating the branch, we can modify the code in this branch without causing disruption on other people work.
Once we done developing in our branch, we can merge it back to the main branch.
