# CodeVersioningWorkshopHomework

In this workshop we learn the basic of how to do code versioning with git and GitHub. Some of the features that we cover are:

### Branching
Branching is a collaborative feature in git that enable us to work on some part of the projects without disturbing the development of other parts of the project.
The best practice is to create a new branch when we want to start developing a new feature. 
A branch will contain the snapshot of the project. After creating the branch, we can modify the code in this branch without causing disruption on other people work.
Once we done developing in our branch, we can merge it back to the main branch.

### Merging
Merging is when we want to consolidate two branches in one repository. 
For example, when we are done with some development on a branch and want to submit the additional code to the master branch.
When we merge 2 branches, it is possible there is some conflicts. This happens when several people have modified one part of codes.
If there are any conflicts, we need to resolve it first before merging the branches.
